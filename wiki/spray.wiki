#summary Stub for the spray RESTful web services framework for Scala

= Introduction =

This is a stub article for [http://spray.cc/ spray], a lightweight Scala framework for building RESTful web services on top of Akka.

_From the [http://spray.cc/ spray wiki]:_

It sports the following main features:

 * Completely asynchronous, non-blocking, actor-based request processing for efficiently handling very high numbers of concurrent connections
 * Powerful, flexible and extensible internal Scala DSL for declaratively defining your web service behavior
 * Immutable model of the HTTP protocol, decoupled from the underlying web server / servlet container
 * Full testability of your REST services, without the need to fire up containers or actors

Apart from a server module spray also has a client component for easy consumption of REST APIs (spray-client) and a JSON module (spray-json).

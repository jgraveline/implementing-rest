Seen Recess?

Here is a vanilla app generated by Recess using the default scaffolding spiced up with some json+schema content types.

#GET /address/1/edit
<form method="POST" action="/address/1">
 <input type="hidden" name="_METHOD" value="PUT" />
 <!-- ... -->
</form>

It also does content negotation.

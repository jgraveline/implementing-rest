== Examples ==
Here is an [http://uforcerec.hackyhack.net/ example app] generated by Recess on top of an existing MySQL database using the default scaffolding spiced up with some json+schema content types ...

{{{
#GET /address/1/edit

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

<form method="POST" action="/address/1">
 <input type="hidden" name="_METHOD" value="PUT" />
 <!-- ... -->
</form>
}}}

{{{
#GET /address.json

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; schema=/address.json+schema

[{"id":"1","addr1":"asdf","addr2":"asdf22","city":"asdf","state":"asdf33","zip":"asdf","tstamp":1254136638,"country":"adsfsd"},{"id":"2","addr1":"asdf","addr2":"asdf","city":"asdf","state":"asdf","zip":"asdf","tstamp":1254197809,"country":"asdf"}]
}}}

{{{
#GET /address/1.json

{"id":"1","addr1":"asdf","addr2":"asdf22","city":"asdf","state":"asdf33","zip":"asdf","tstamp":1254136638,"country":"adsfsd"}

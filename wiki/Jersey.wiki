=== Sample ===
_From Sun's [http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/820-4867/ggnxo?l=en&a=view RESTful Web Services Developer's Guide]_

The following code sample is a very simple example of a root resource class using JAX-RS annotations. The sample shown here is from the samples that ship with Jersey, and which can be found in the following directory of that installation: 
{{{
jersey/samples/helloworld/src/main/java/com/sun/jersey/samples/helloworld/resources/HelloWorldResource.java.

 package com.sun.jersey.samples.helloworld.resources;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;

// The Java class will be hosted at the URI path "/helloworld"
@Path("/helloworld")
public class HelloWorldResource {
    
    // The Java method will process HTTP GET requests
    @GET
    // The Java method will produce content identified by the MIME Media
    // type "text/plain"
    @Produces("text/plain")
    public String getClichedMessage() {
        // Return some cliched textual content
        return "Hello World";
    }
}

#summary Stub for the Akka HTTP Module

= Introduction =

This is a stub article for the [http://doc.akka.io/http Akka HTTP Module], an add-on module for the actor-based Akka platform.

_From the [http://doc.akka.io/http Akka HTTP Module page]:_

 Akka supports the JSR for REST called JAX-RS (JSR-311). It allows you to create interaction with your actors through HTTP + REST.

 The Mist layer was developed to provide a direct connection between the servlet container and Akka actors with the goal of handling the incoming HTTP request as quickly as possible in an asynchronous manner.

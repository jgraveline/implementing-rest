=== Does a service have to implement the PUT and DELETE methods to be considered RESTful? ===

"In any case, there are plenty of RESTful services that do nothing but GET and POST. The key is how those methods are used, not what methods are used. To give a specific example, what makes a wiki more or less RESTful is almost always determined by how it (ab)uses GET and sessions -- whether it uses PUT or POST for editing pages is sugar topping in comparison."
